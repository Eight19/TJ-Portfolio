    <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>Tiffany Jones is no stranger to hard work and delivering extraordinary service. With over 16 years of combined experience in Property Management, Project Management, Real Estate, and Notary Public, Tiffany decided to make a change and take her career to another level. After doing some research, she found that Software Development intrigued her the most. She has also always had an interest in the creating and building of innovative technology and made the decision to open the door. She realized that the tech world feels like home and began to walk in the new world of endless possibilities. She  always had a passion to serve and knows that her purpose is to help others. Part of this passion also led her to join the U.S. Army Reserve in which, she served from 2003-2011 as an Automated Logistical Specialist (92A). She even won a honorary medal during AIT for her singing of the National Anthem at a rewards ceremony for officers. Tiffany also enjoys giving back in her role as an Operational Shelter Supervisor for the American Red Cross and as also as a volunteer with the American Cancer Society. She cultivates lifelong relationships through constant commitment, building trust, and delivering results.</p>
